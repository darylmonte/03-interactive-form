# Interactive Form
My third project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree.The objective is to enhance interactive registration form through JavaScript.

The improvements include increased accessibility, validate user input, provide hints in case of invalid information, and display or hide sections depending on user input.

Other enhancement includes real-time validation to the required fields. It validates the current active field at a time.

An additional conditional error message has been added to the email field. It gives an error message if the email field is blank instead of the default error message that only checks for proper formatting.
